# UmRella App

Welcome to the **UmRella App** repository! This app offers a convenient and innovative way to access umbrella stations across campus, with integrated weather forecasting. Built as part of the Mobile Application Development course at **Amrita School of Computing**, UmRella enhances campus life by providing real-time umbrella availability, booking options, and weather forecasts for a seamless experience.

## ‚òÇÔ∏è Project Overview
The **UmRella App** aims to simplify umbrella access for users by letting them locate, reserve, and return umbrellas at designated campus stations. The app combines weather predictions to suggest umbrella usage, making it ideal for unexpected rain showers and promoting shared resource usage among students.

## üå¶Ô∏è Weather Forecast and Umbrella Booking
This app not only enables umbrella booking but also provides a real-time weather forecast, helping users decide if an umbrella is necessary based on current conditions.

### üåç Data Sources
- **Weather Data**: Leveraging the OpenWeatherMap API for live weather data and forecast updates. we used a historical weather dataset from Kaggle: [Weather Dataset - Rattle Package](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jsphyg/weather-dataset-rattle-package).
- **Umbrella Status Tracking**: Uses Firebase Realtime Database to manage and update umbrella availability.
